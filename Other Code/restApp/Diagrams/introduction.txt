This purpose of the project given to the creators was to create an application that could interface with a Human Task Management (HTM) server via Representation State Transfers (REST).  This specific project focused on creating the application using the Android Mobile framework from Google built on top of Oracle's Java SDK.  REST requests can be defined as sending an HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to a server at a specific URI for the object you are looking for (i.e. /posts/1 might select a post with an id of 1), providing any specific data that may be required for modifying the structure (as in the case of POST and PUT).

The Android project focused on providing a unique and useful User Interface for the end user to be able to view and modify any accounts and tasks that exist on the server.  Users are required to pass in credentials to access this data on the server so that all data is secure.

Using REST, caching techniques on the phone, and Android's unique mobile presentation, the creators developed a first-look at what a possible user interface implementation of this project might be.  The following sections describe how each area of the application was developed in regards to this project.
