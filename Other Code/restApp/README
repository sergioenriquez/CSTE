Description
	This android application was developed to provide a client program for use with the 
	human task management system developed by Daniel Schulte. The application uses a RESTful
	interface to exchange data with a web server in charge of storing the task and user information.
	A user may store the login information for multiple accounts, edit or create tasks for each one offline,
	and then synchronized them with the server one a network connection is availible.
	
Login
	To store the login information for a new user, on the home screen press the MENU key and then select the add user button. 
	Enter the user URI previously assigned by the server, and also the username and password.
	
	When the application is re-launched, it will display a list of the account previously used with this deveice. To view the task 
	list for a user, click on one of the entries displayed.
	
Task management
	From the task list screen, press the MENU key to display a menu screen with the options to add a new task, sort or filter the displayed tasks, 
	synchronize with the server, or go back to the accounts screen.
	
	To view the task details, simply click on one of the displayed entries. To edit or delete a task, click and hold one of the entries to display
	a contextual menu with these options.
	
	When editing a task, a text tag may be added to help organize and search this task later. Tags should be separated by a comma when entered.
